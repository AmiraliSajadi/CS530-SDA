# CS530-SDA
Project for the CS 530


## Setup
Your Python3 version needs to be below 3.12. Python 3.10 was used to install the required packages. Using a virtual environment is strongly recommended. Navigate to the root folder and:
`virtualenv ./myenv`

install the required packages:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Set your system variables
You need to set the two variables used in *config.py*:
- OASIS_DATABASE_URL

## Run the Flask app
just run the *run.py* file in the root directory:

`python run.py`
